# The version controlled story

This folder contains a story that I want help with. It is just a boring start and needs some serious work. 
Please extend it and improve it! How good can we make this?

* Fork the course repository on github.com.
* Make a local copy of the repository on your hard disk (using `git clone` etc).
* Edit the file `the_story.md` and commit the change(s).
* Push the file to your github repository.
* Make a pull request to me.

I will try to handle pull requests as they come in. Since you are likely to make edits in parallel,
I might discard some story suggestions. It is not story quality, but
my convenience that determines how the story evolves.

Also, you are very welcome to pull edits from my repository to your repository and make more edits.

Here are the rules:

* You can add, edit, and remove text. But it is probably most fun with story additions and minor modifications.
* Be a good community member.
* No derogatory language of any sorts.
* Keep it in English.
* The text is written in Markdown format. Keep it that way.
