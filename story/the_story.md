# A story in DA3018

Once upon a time, by a lake called _Brunnsviken_, there was a grand castle
made of red bricks. 

Inside the castle there lived a very old and decrepit mathematician, simply called The mathematician. But The mathematician had to abandon the castle for unknown reasons and move to the cold and echoing streets of Albano house 1. There, The mathematician spent the days batteling against the constantly breaking automatic doors. But one day he had had enough, he was going to take back his castle, no matter the cost. The mathematician knew that, to succeed, he would need the most cunning, most ingenious, most devious scheme possible. However, he also knew he would not be able to pull this off on his own, so The mathematician decided to seek out the brilliant, but deceitful,  Professor X.

The mathematician knew from experience that Professor X was at the root of most problems, but he also knew that the Professor had an incredible talent for coming up with and being part of complex and daring solutions. So, The mathematician set out to find Professor X, determined to convince him to join forces and take back the castle. But where could the Professor be found? This deceitful charachter had the habit of hiding just about everywhere. There where multiple dimensions to search through, and it all seemed so hopeless. But then the Mathematician remembered, that time when the Professor was found in an everyday problem of the easy to solve variety. The hope was not lost, as long as the Mathematician was prepared to be creative and think outside of the box.

One thing the Matematician was sure of, was that the location of Professor X was secret. So the Mathematician decided to make a visit an old friend, living in the Twoer of Nature just north of the Castle. This old friend was Alice, and Bob had told the Matematician that Alice was a master of secrets. Maybe she had a clue about the secrets of where to find the Professor...
